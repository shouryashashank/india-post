The major problem which has plagued the overall freight transport procedure is the excessive Turnaround Time (TAT) and Dwell Time. This delays the whole procedure and hence the productivity decreases.
 
We have designed a solution which replaces the old and time-consuming paper-work procedure with an IT-enabled platform. The ship managers uploads the required documents and information of the containers to be approved by the port administrators.
 
Using the data, the platform assigns each container with a truck and allocates each truck a time-slot. The crane directly puts the container on the trucks at the given time-slot. The proposed solution removes the dependencies in the timing of the trucks by allocating time slots to the truckers. A similar queuing approach is pursued for trains carrying goods as well, considering train congestion in tracks. The proposed solution can potentially lead to an estimated reduction of around 35 hours in TAT and 40 hours in Dwell time, per ship.
 
The similar procedure is implemented on the CFSs/ICDs so that there is no further delay in goods distribution. The authentication and verification are also taken into consideration to ensure that no random person can log in and disrupt the database.
