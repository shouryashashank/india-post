# How to build and run app on local server 
Step 1: 
Go to the Apache Friends website and download XAMPP for Windows. For the easiest install, download the Basic Package's "self-extracting RAR archive." Wait for the download to finish and open it to begin installing XAMPP. Click the "Install" button to start the file extraction. When the Command Prompt screen appears, press the "Enter" key at every question to accept default settings.

Step 2:
Start the XAMPP program. When started, XAMPP loads itself into your icon tray. The icon is orange with a white bone-like shape in its center. Single-click the icon to expand the Control Panel. Click on the "Start" button next to "Apache" to start your Apache Web server. When Apache is running, the word "Running" will appear next to it, highlighted in green. Also start "MySQL" if your PHP scripts depend on a MySQL database to run.

move the directory to htdocs/

Add database/database.sql.zip to my php admin
